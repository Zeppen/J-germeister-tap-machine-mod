1. Get a 3'n 1 rco420
2. Get a Eliwell EW961 (thermostat) https://amzn.to/2XOhDbw

How to wire:

From the power inlet, after the fuse, put the red wire (live) into pin 3 on the Eliwell EW961
From the power inlet, after the fuse, put the black wire (neutral) into pin 4 on the Eliwell EW961

Rco420 (220V) or Rco410 (110V)
Red wire - to the top left of the compressor pins. 
White wire - to the top right of the compressor pins. 
Black wire - to the bottom compressor pin. 
One black wire into pin 2 on the Eliwell EW961. 
The other black wire into pin 4 on the Eliwell EW961. 

The black wire feeding the fan, put it into pin 2 on the Eliwell EW961. 
The red wire feeding the fan, put it into pin 4 on the Eliwell EW961.

Cut the temperature cord and feed it into pin 7 and 8.


Power on and the JÃ¤germeister Tap Machine will start. 


I will add how to change the high low settings on the Eliwell EW961. 
Mine is set on - 18*C now ðŸ¤“
