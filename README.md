Modifying the Jägermeister tap machine 

Here's the beginning of a tutorial on how to modify a Jägermeister tap machine with a broken thermostat. 
Jägermeister Tap Machine https://amzn.to/2zbCQSt

1. Get a 3 N' 1 Relay Overload Start Capacitor RCO420 https://amzn.to/2XOhDbw
2. Get a Eliwell EW961 (thermostat) https://amzn.to/2XOhDbw

How to wire:

From the power inlet, after the fuse, put the red wire (live) into pin 3 on the Eliwell EW961
From the power inlet, after the fuse, put the black wire (neutral) into pin 4 on the Eliwell EW961

Rco420 (220V) or Rco410 (110V)
Red wire - to the top left of the compressor pins. 
White wire - to the top right of the compressor pins. 
Black wire - to the bottom compressor pin. 
One black wire into pin 2 on the Eliwell EW961. 
The other black wire into pin 4 on the Eliwell EW961. 

The black wire feeding the fan, put it into pin 2 on the Eliwell EW961. 
The red wire feeding the fan, put it into pin 4 on the Eliwell EW961.

Cut the temperature cord and feed it into pin 7 and 8.


Power on and the Jägermeister Tap Machine will start. 


Hold SET on the Eliwell EW961 for 5 seconds, then press up/down to get to the menu PBa
put it to code 22 and then press SET
change the settings on High vs Low to get the correct interval for your thermostat.
Preferrably something between -14 and -22. This will be the interval possible to change in between.
After that is done, set the thermostat by pressing SET and then change it to -18 Celicus.

IF you prefer Farenheit you can change that in the settings of the ELiwell EW961 too.
Since I live in a civilized country, I prefer Celcius ;)

Good Luck now, and enjoy your Jägermeister ice cold..
